# Build An Alexa Smart Properties Skill
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/quiz-game/header._TTH_.png" />

This is a sample Alexa skill for [Alexa Smart Properties (ASP)](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-smart-properties). Please note that ASP skills are hidden from the public catalog by default, and can only be enabled on selected properties. To use this skill in an ASP organization, you are required to have an active ASP subscription, with properties and rooms (where the skill can be enalbed).
You also MUST enable your Vendor ID for Name-Free Interactions (NFI). See the instructions below.
If you are looking for sample skills for the regular consumer version of Alexa, please refer to [Alexa Samples](https://github.com/alexa-samples) instead. 
This skill acts as an assistant in a hospitality facility. Guests can ask questions such as "Alexa, tell me about the pool" or make requests like "Alexa, where is the hotel conference center", "Alexa, where is the hotel cafe", "Alexa, please checkout". Feel free to use this sample skill as a reference, or as a template to build your own property skill(s).


## Contents
The contents of this repository is broken down into a few sub-folders.
### Skill-package
This is a copy the sample skill's interaction model. It defines the invocation name, intents and various metadata. In other words, it defines how questions can be understood. For example, an user asking "Alexa, please checkout" can be mapped to a "Checkout intent" through a generic intent handler interface.
### Lambda
This is the backend of the sample skill. It defines how questions how handled on the server-side. This sample uses Node.js 18.x environment and would be hosted on AWS Lambda. However, you have the flexibility to decide where your backend will be hosted, and what programming language to code it with.
Parts of the lambda code are left for you to implement. For example, if your property has a staff notification system (via text etc.) that can be called via an API, you can modify the help intent handler such that whenever a user asks Alexa for help, Alexa automatically opens a ticket to your staff.
### Name-Free Interactions (NFI)
NFI allows a skill to be invoked without specifying its invocation name. For instance instead of saying "Alexa, ask [skill name] please checkout", users can simply say "Alexa, please checkout". In this repository we have included a sample list of golden utterances. For more information on NFI, please refer to [Understanding Name-Free Interaction for custom skills](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/understand-name-free-interaction-for-custom-skills.html).

## Using This Sample Skill
If you intend to use this sample skill as a template to build your own property skill, here are the recommended high level steps:
1. Create a blank, custom Alexa skill using either the [skill console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask) or [command line interface (CLI)](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html). This step ensures your skill is assigned with a unique ID, and that it has the right dependency files (e.g. node_modules).
2. Use [ASK CLI commands](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smapi/ask-cli-command-reference.html) to configure your new skill on a local workspace.
3. Copy the contents of skill-package and lambda to your workspace. It is important that you retain the skill ID and workspace configurations created in the previous step.
4. Use ASK CLI to perform deployment. If set up correctly, it should publish both the skill's interaction model as well as lambda.
5. Afterwards, you can start customizing the skill!
